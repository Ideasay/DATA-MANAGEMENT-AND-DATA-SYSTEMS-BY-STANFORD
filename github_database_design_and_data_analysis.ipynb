        "\n",
        "*  *GitHub*: GitHub is a source-control service provider.  GitHub allows you to collaborate on and keep track of source code in a fairly efficient way.\n",
        "\n",
        "*  *commit*: A commit can be thought of as a change that is applied to some set of files. i.e., if some set of files is in some state A, you can make changes to A and *commit* your changes to the set of files so that it is now in state B.  A commit is identified by a *hash* of the information in your change (the author of the commit, who actually committed [i.e. applied] the changes to the set of files, the changes themselves, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "* *parent commit*: The commit that came before your current commit.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   *repo*:  A repo (short for repository) is GitHub's abstraction for a collection of files along with a history of commits on those files. If you have GitHub username \"foo\" and you make a repository called \"data-rocks\", your repo name will be \"foo/data-rocks\".  You can think of a repo's history in terms of its commits.  E.g., \"foo/data-rocks\" can have the set of \"states\" A->B->C->D, where each state change (A->B, B->C, C->D) was due to a commit.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   *branch*:  To keep track of different commit histories, GitHub repos can have branches.  The 'main' branch (i.e. commit history) of the repo is called the 'master' branch.  Say on \"foo/data-rocks\" we have the commit history A->B->C->D on the master branch.  If someone else comes along and decides to add a cool new feature to \"foo/data-rocks\", they can create a branch called \"cool-new-feature\" that branches away from the master branch. All the code from the main branch will be there, but new code added to \"cool-new-feature\" will not be on the main branch.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   *ref*: For the purpose of this assignment, you can think of the 'ref' field on the \"files\" table as referring to the branch in which a file lives in a repository at some point in time.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
