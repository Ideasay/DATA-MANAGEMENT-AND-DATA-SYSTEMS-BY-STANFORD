These are the four basic data operations. You can create/read/update/delete the values in a database, or the schema of a database (eg, add/delete a property, or change its type). \n","\n","* When you think about advantages and disadvantages in software, some of the common desirable attributes are - performance (how fast queries run), memory footprint (less is better), maintainability (can the database gracefully change with product requirements?), and code complexity (does a db design encourage large, unwieldy queries? Programmers are human after all - the more complexity, the more bugs!). Combining these attributes with the operations above should give you a place to start your comparison.\n","\n","* An extra hint: We haven't talked about performance in databases yet, but for the purposes of this question, you can think in three tiers:\n","  * Lookup: You have a key of a table, and you want the row (or some subset of the row). You can conceptualize this as O(1)\n","  * Scan: When you need to lookup rows by some criteria (eg, people taller than 6 feet). Height is not a key, so the database has to scan all the rows. You can conceptualize this as O(N). Scanning also happens when writing a property to many rows at once.\n","  * Join: When you join tables together, it creates a Cartesian Product of sets (also called pairs). If there are N rows in a table, and another table has roughly the same number of rows (so N there too), then you can think of a two-table join as O(N^2).\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"hW1nT3liliTK","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---\n","\n","# OKV vs Relational Databases\n","\n","*   **Performance**: \n","        1.

Ultimately we care about the chart, so if you're aggregating the same data stored in a different way, that's fine (eg population by decade instead of population by phase of life). Some indicators will lead to easier solutions though, so we encourage you to spend some time making sure you've got one that feels straightforward to use.
